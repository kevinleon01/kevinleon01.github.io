<h2><i>Some thoughts</i></h2>

<p> I've been trying to work </p>
<p> On my memory </p>
<p> Shuffling through brain foods </p>
<p> Like salmon and peanuts </p>
<p> I've stolen six cameras </p>
<p> I rarely use them </p>
<p> When my back hurts </p>
<p> I take some advil </p>
<p> Sometimes when i feel fine </p>
<p> I take some advil </p>
<p> The world we live in </p>
<p> Things vary by degrees </p>
<p> Feels weird to walk around being </p>
<p> Ninety-eight-point-six degrees </p>
<p> Sometimes misremembering </p>
<p> Just feels good tho </p>
<p> Even still </p>
<p> I should get more sleep </p>
