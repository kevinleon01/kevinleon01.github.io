<h2><i>One of Us</i></h2>

<p>     The dog sizes up the trash can and knocks it down. Empty wine bottles and napkins stained with all kinds
 of crazy colors spill out. Deep maroons and electric blues. A puddle of brown water. The dog eats the napkins,
 along with anything else she manages to fit in her mouth. Plantain peels and untraceable hairs. Her breath stinks 
of yesterday’s breakfast and rotting paper.
	<br>     “She’s just one of the boys,” Madison says to Alex and Nick. “She’s one of y’all.”
	<br>     “Yeah that dumb slut is one of us,” replies Nick.
	<br>     “Ladybug stop eating garbage. This is why your breath stinks. You’re gonna throw up on the couch again,” says Alex. 
	<br>     “It’s okay Ladybug, don’t listen to them,” says Madison.
<br>
	<br>The dog did throw up on the couch that night after everyone went to bed.
